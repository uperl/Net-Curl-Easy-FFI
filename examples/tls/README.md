# TLS example server

Contained in this directory is an `nginx` config and certificate/key files
for to run the SSL/TLS examples.  They were generated using [easy-rsa](https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa),
which allows you to create your own Certificate Authority (CA).  The private
key and the CA are public, and should in no way ever be used for real
production configurations!
